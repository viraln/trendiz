Introduction to Pokémon
Pokémon was created in 1995 by Satoshi Tajiri as a video game for the Nintendo Game Boy. The game took place in a world where humans catch fictional creatures called Pokémon (short for pocket monsters) and train them to battle other Pokémon. ![The World of Pokémon - Image 1](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486572788966-cfd3df1f5b42?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3MjE4ODJ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxQb2tlbW9uJTIwcG9rbW9uJTIwZ2FtZXxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzQxNzk0MTEwfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

The video games proved extremely popular, soon spawning a companion anime series, a trading card game, toys, movies, and more. Over the past 25+ years, the Pokémon franchise has grown into one of the most successful media properties ever created. 

Key Pokémon Games
While new Pokémon video games continue to be developed, several key titles stand out:

- Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire (2002) - The first Pokémon games for the Game Boy Advance added 135 new Pokémon.

The strategy of Pokémon battles also presents challenges for serious gamers. And the social element of trading cards and battling friends helps bring people together.
